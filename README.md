# COVID-19 Data Analysis Notebook

This project provides an analysis of the spread of COVID-19 using confirmed case data and investigates its correlation with World Happiness Report indicators. The aim is to understand the pandemic's progression and explore how socio-economic indicators might relate to infection rates.

## üîç Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loaded COVID-19 confirmed cases dataset.
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Aggregated data at the country level.

### 2. Visualization
- Visualized COVID-19 spread over time.
- Plotted data for specific countries (e.g., China) to analyze trends.

### 3. Infection Rate Calculation
- Calculated the first derivative (rate of change) of COVID-19 spread.
- Identified maximum infection rates for each country.
- Created a simplified dataframe with maximum infection rates.

### 4. Merging with World Happiness Data
- Loaded and cleaned World Happiness Report data.
- Selected relevant features: GDP per capita, social support, health life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.
- Merged with infection rate data.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
- Analyzed correlation between happiness indicators and infection rates.
- Produced a correlation matrix and visualized it using a heatmap.

### 6. Final Visualization
- Plotted relationships between variables such as GDP vs. infection rate and health expectancy vs. infection rate.

## üìà Key Insights

- The maximum infection rate varied widely by country.
- Some socio-economic factors showed potential correlation with the spread of COVID-19.
- Visualization and analysis provided meaningful insights into the global dynamics of the pandemic.

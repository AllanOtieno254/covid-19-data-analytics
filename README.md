# The Tale of COVID Through Data and Code  
Where numbers speak and insights explode  

In this notebook lies a tale so grand,  
Of viral trends that swept the land.  
With Python’s might and datasets wide,  
We traced the paths where numbers hide.  


## Tools We Trust in Every Frame  
The heroes with the longest name  

From pandas, numpy, seaborn too,  
Matplotlib helped us paint the view.  
Scikit-learn came in to play,  
When stats and trends led us astray.  


## The Data: Echoes of the Past  
Where every row was built to last  

We fetched the files from folders deep,  
Where daily counts refused to sleep.  
Confirmed cases lined the sheet,  
Each country marching to the beat.  

First, we checked the dataframe's size,  
Then trimmed the fat — a neat surprise.  
Dropped columns we could do without,  
Left only those that held some clout.  


## Let’s Group and Gather What We Know  
To help the visualization flow  

We grouped the rows by nations’ name,  
To track which ones endured the flame.  
And China first, we put on stage,  
Its numbers stretched across the page.  


## The Curve, the Slope, the Viral Rise  
We analyzed with eagle eyes  

A measure strong, we had to find,  
To show how COVID gripped mankind.  
The first derivative revealed the pace,  
How quickly it could sweep a place.  

We found the peak, infection rate,  
When each country met its fate.  
Created frames both small and lean,  
To match the stats with what they mean.  


## A Twist — Let’s Mix With Worldly Cheer  
What made some nations persevere?  

We brought the Happiness Report,  
To see which nations held the fort.  
Health, freedom, GDP we chose,  
To find what softened COVID’s blows.  

Joined both datasets, line by line,  
Mapped the stats and found design.  
Correlation gave the clues,  
On how the happy paid their dues.  


## Graphs That Speak When Words Fall Short  
Analytics' most compelling sport  

With seaborn’s style and matplotlib’s grace,  
We drew the trends for every place.  
Bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps too,  
Each told a story clear and true.  


## So Here It Ends — Our Data Song  
In rows and plots, we’ve journeyed long  

From China’s start to Europe’s test,  
To happy lands that fared the best.  
May every number here you see,  
Guide your steps in inquiry.  
This notebook is a rhyming scroll,  
Where data danced and stories stole.
